#  Lunchinator 3000 Service

My implementation of the Lunchinator service. I took some extra time to build the service since I wanted to try and use some frameworks that were new to me including:

```
* [Eclipse Vert.x](http://www.vertx.io)
* [rxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
```
These frameworks allowed me to experiment with reactive java programming and start to learn how to develop with messaging and response handling.
